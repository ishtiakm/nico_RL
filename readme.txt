## CSCI 6963 - FALL 2023 - Homework 04 ##
Author: Nicolas Lizaralde - lizarn@rpi.edu

To run the script, open a terminal and run:
python3 cliff_mdf-Lizarralde.py

The script will run by itself, while printing some messages on the terminal, such as
- Current epsilon value
- Calculated states values
- Episode initial state value
- Discounted reward average for episodes
- Average number of transitions for episodes

The discounted reward average converges to the episode initial state value, for different initial states.
This behavior can be checked by changing the value of the variable init_state.

The script is tested on Ubuntu 20.04/22.04.
